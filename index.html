        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        
        <span id="aboutme"> 
            I am learning software engineering to better my life and create a better life for my kids as well. I served in the USMC from 2008 to 2012.

            I have bounced around from job to job since getting out of the Marines and never felt like I was in the right position.

            I am enjoying learning coding due to the complexity of it. Complex puzzles that make me think and learn are what I thrive on.

            What am I looking for in an employer?
        </h3>

        <p> 
            Im looking for a position that I can thrive in with possibilities of advancement. I need an employer that can recognize my capabilities and give me challenging projects to help me better myself
            in the software engineering field. I will always strive to learn and grow, so I need my employer to strive for the same. Coming in to this field now gives me an advantage due to having so 
            much to learn. "Knowledge is power". It has been stated by greater people than I but it speaks to me on many levels. The more I know, the better I can become.
