            I Worked for Midwest Macinery in Wadena, Minnesota for 6 montsh as a Parts Manager, helping customers on a daily basis and fulfilling orders.
            Restocking, shipping and receiving, and customer relations were only a few aspects of my job.
                <br>

            <p id="PK">Before Midwest Machinery, I was with P&K Equipment in Shawnee Oklahoma as a Parts Salesman. During my time at P&K I took care of customers at the counter as my primary focus. I also worked in the back doing inventory counts and receiving freight deliveries in the morning.
