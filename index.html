            I am learning software engineering to better my life and create a better life for my kids as well. I served in the USMC from 2008 to 2012.

            I have bounced around from job to job since getting out of the Marines and never felt like I was in the right position.

            I am enjoying learning coding due to the complexity of it. Complex puzzles that make me think and learn are what I thrive on.
