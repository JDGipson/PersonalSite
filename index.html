      <h3>Who am I?</h3>

      <ul id="CoreValue">
        <li>Honor</li>
        <li>Courage</li>
        <li>Commitment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These core values have stuck with me throughout my life after being in
        the marines. Honor tells us to uphold our core values and morales. Be
        honest and always do your best. Courage is to always push forward even
        in the face of adversity. Commitment is the most important value here.
        It could mean staying on task when everyone tells you to take a break,
        or staying with your company and working with them through the hard
        times.

      <span id="aboutme">
        I served in the USMC from 2008 to 2012. It was a hard life and even
        harder decision, but the best decision I ever made. I have bounced
        around from job to job since getting out of the Marines and never felt
        like I was in the right position. So I turned to software engineering
        after talking to a few friends that work in the same field. I am
        enjoying learning coding due to the complexity of it. Complex puzzles
        that make me think and learn are what I thrive on.

      <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>

      <p>
        I am learning software engineering to better my life and create a better
        life for my kids as well. After working for multiple companies in many
        different positions I am ready to have a stable foundation that will
        carry me through life. I don't want to be working for someone for a year
        and then finding a new position somewhere else due to not being
        challenged or getting bored with my day to day. Software engineering has
        opend my eyes to a whole new spectrum of knowledge and capabilities. I
        already have lots of ideas and fun things I would like to try.
      </p>

      <h3>What am I looking for in an employer?</h3>

      <p>
        Im looking for a position that I can thrive in with possibilities of
        advancement. I need an employer that can recognize my capabilities and
        give me challenging projects to help me better myself in the software
        engineering field. I will always strive to learn and grow, so I need my
        employer to strive for the same. Coming in to this field now gives me an
        advantage due to having so much to learn. "Knowledge is power". It has
        been stated by greater people than I but it speaks to me on many levels.
        The more I know, the better I can become.
