                This is the beginning of my first website. Please bare with me as I learn and grow and make this website better with every passing week.

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Honor</li>
            <li>Courage</li>
            <li>Commitment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These core values have stuck with me throughout my life after being in the marines. Honor tells us to uphold our core values and morales. Be honest and always do your best.
            Courage is to always push forward even in the face of adversity. Commitment is the most important value here. It could mean staying on task when everyone tells you to take a break, or staying with your company and working with them through the hard times.

        <span id="aboutme"> 
            I served in the USMC from 2008 to 2012. It was a hard life and even harder decision, but the best decision I ever made.

            I have bounced around from job to job since getting out of the Marines and never felt like I was in the right position. So I turned to software engineering after talking to a few friends that work in the same field.


            I am enjoying learning coding due to the complexity of it. Complex puzzles that make me think and learn are what I thrive on.

        <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
        <!-- //change this section name// -->
        <p>
            I am learning software engineering to better my life and create a better life for my kids as well.
        </p>


        <h3>
            What am I looking for in an employer?
        </h3>

        <p> 
            Im looking for a position that I can thrive in with possibilities of advancement. I need an employer that can recognize my capabilities and give me challenging projects to help me better myself
            in the software engineering field. I will always strive to learn and grow, so I need my employer to strive for the same. Coming in to this field now gives me an advantage due to having so 
            much to learn. "Knowledge is power". It has been stated by greater people than I but it speaks to me on many levels. The more I know, the better I can become.
